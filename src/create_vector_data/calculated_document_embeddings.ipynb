    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook is used as an example of building and interacting with a chromadb embeddings database using a locally stored and downloaded embeddings model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will be using the [instructor-xl embedding model](https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/instructor-xl) which looks create an embedding that allows matching between prompts and relevant documents. This is a relatively flexible embedding model and is more closely aligned to our end-goal of a simple proof-of-concept of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to using Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Method\n",
    "## Approach for embedding\n",
    "To embed the files, we will be turning them into reasonably sized text chunks and storing them in a static, on-disk chromadb vector database which can be loaded and used for searching.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show some simple walkthroughs of this and the associated calculated_document_embeddings.py script turns this into more consistent functions for re-use and with better documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use-case we are considering here is largely an asymmetric embedding problem where the query text may be a very different size to the stored text for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "For similarity measures in the embedding space, we can consider both the cosine similarity and raw dot-product but noting they are each likely to favour different potential answer lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text chunking strategy\n",
    "We will aim for context-aware text chunks. This can be file / format specific (i.e Markdown, HTML, code, etc)\n",
    "and will allow for some overlap between these text cunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, I'd reccommend you pick a python kernel built to match the requirements specified in pyproject.toml and to use Poetry to manage the dependecies and virtual environment. I have added the pip magic command to install relevant packages in this notebook but it would be unnecessary if you set up an appropriate virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example data\n",
    "I've downloaded various books that are out of copyright. These are:\n",
    "* Moby Dick converted to five formats:\n",
    "  * txt\n",
    "  * docx\n",
    "  * pdf (but with text encoded)\n",
    "  * markdown\n",
    "  * html\n",
    "* Pride and Prejudice as a PDF\n",
    "* Romeo and Juliet as a PDF"
